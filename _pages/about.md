<p align="justify" vspace = "-0px" width="200px"> Welcome! I am a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href="https://atmo.tamu.edu/">Department of Atmospheric Sciences</a> at Texas A&M University. I study atmospheric convection, specifically deep convective clouds using observations from weather radars and lightning mapping array. I am currently working on disentangling the role of background meteorology and aerosols on deep convective updrafts as part of the <a href="https://www.arm.gov/research/campaigns/amf2021tracer">DOE TRACER field campaign</a>. As part of my Ph.D. dissertation at <a href="https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>, I worked on identification and tracking of polarimetric fingerprints such as differential reflectivity (Z<sub>DR</sub>) and specific differential phase (K<sub>DP</sub>) columns in tornadic storms. I also utilized ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) radar data assimilation to study cold pool-lightning covariability while simulating these tornadic storms.</p>

======

**April 2024:** 

I am excited to share that a paper based on my Ph.D. dissertation has been accepted for publication in the AMS Monthly Weather Review. This paper delves into the observational analysis of radar and lightning signatures in nonclassic tornadic storms in the southeast U.S. Titled 'Investigating Temporal Characteristics of Polarimetric and Electrical Signatures in Three Severe Storms: Insights from the VORTEX-Southeast Field Campaign,' it offers valuable insights into the cloud microphysical processes and their role in storm electrification. Stay tuned for the EOR link!
